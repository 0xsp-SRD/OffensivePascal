# How To Compile 
- if you interested in cross-compiling, yes that's possible you can do that easily using the following automated tool (https://github.com/LongDirtyAnimAlf/fpcupdeluxe) 
- you can install Lazarus IDE directly (https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads).
- dealing with Pascal is easy, all you have to do is import a project and build. 
- for complicated projects which needs some third-party modules/packages, i will add detailed instructions for installing and compiling.
